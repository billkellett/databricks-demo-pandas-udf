# databricks-demo-pandas-udf

This project contains a notebook and other resources for a __Databricks Pandas User-Defined Functions demo__.

To install and run this demo in your own Databricks environment:

1. Download the .dbc file from the /notebooks folder and import it into Databricks (for some reason I have trouble importing this as a URL).

2. Open the notebook and follow its step-by-step instructions.
